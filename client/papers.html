      <p>ICACIE 2022 focuses on both theory and applications in the broad areas of advanced computing 
        and intelligent engineering. ICACIE is a multidisciplinary conference organized with the objective 
        of bringing together academicians, scientists, researchers from industry, research scholars, and 
        students working in all areas of advanced computing and intelligent engineering. The conference 
        will provide the authors and listeners with opportunities for national and international collaboration 
        and networking among universities and institutions from India and abroad for promoting research and
        developing technologies. The aim of this conference is to promote the translation of basic research
        into applied investigation and convert applied investigation into practice. This conference will
        also create awareness about the importance of basic scientific research in different fields 
        matching the current trends. The conference will provide the flavor of keynote lectures by 
        eminent speakers from different areas & panel discussions by industry people. The scope of 
        the conference includes all areas of Advanced Computing and Intelligent Engineering. The 
        various areas of ICACIE 2021 include but are not limited to the following:
